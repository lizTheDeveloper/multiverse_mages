    //    so creating them shifts every handle allocated afterwards and re-rolls

    //    owning every scribe cohort and sharing the universe's pool are
    //    arithmetically the same thing — 142 books over 36 ticks on both.

    //    the run sees a different graph. A pure renumbering moves things in
    //    both directions; here it moved one thing.
    // 2. **`seek-teaching` can now be satisfied by the shelf.** A mage with no
    //    living teacher and a readable book studies it instead of falling
    //    through, which changes what she spends a month on and therefore where
    //    she is standing twenty years later. That is the mechanic and not a
